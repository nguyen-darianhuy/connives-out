# Connives Out
## VR Murder Mystery Experience
This is "Connives Out" (a reference to the movie "Knives Out" :D). I was inspired by games like L.A. Noire and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney where the player plays the role of a detective.

Main gameplay features:
- Playtime: ~15-20 min
- Exploring crime scenes (in this case, it's a murder scene taking place in a house)
- Examining evidence
- Using special tools to uncover hidden evidence
- Questioning suspects/witnesses

I wanted to keep this experience very simple, so questioning witnesses is very linear. Basically, if you have enough evidence, you can continue talking to them. Once you have exhausted their dialogue, you can choose whether or not to accuse them, which ends the game and gives you an ending scenario based on if you accused the correct person.
